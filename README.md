# interview-algorithms

Here is my storage of algorithms that were asked in interviews or I found on the internet that seem interesting to me.

## About This Repository

- This is a casual collection without a strict structure (for now, at least).
- I might organize it better later, but no promises!
- You'll find algorithms implemented in various languages:
  - Go
  - C
  - C++
  - Python

Feel free to explore, but don't expect a super organized layout. This is more of a personal playground for interesting algorithmic stuff I come across.
